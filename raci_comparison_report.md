# RACI Extraction Comparison Report

## What I Found vs HTML Templates

### My Extraction Results:
1. **Persona Types Used**: ✓ Correctly using actual persona types (backend-developer, software-architect, etc.)
2. **Phase Grouping**: ✓ Added (INITIALIZATION, DEVELOPMENT, REVIEW, etc.)
3. **Accountability**: ✓ Added, but needs refinement
4. **System/Tool Involvement**: ✓ Correctly excluded (they can't be R/A)

### Key Differences Found:

#### 1. Missing Responsible Assignments in System Workflows
- **Issue**: System workflows (wf0-wf17) show empty responsible arrays
- **Expected**: Should show which personas would execute these workflows
- **Example**: wf0-feature-development should show developers as responsible

#### 2. Accountability Patterns
- **Current**: Default to engineering-manager for system workflows
- **HTML Shows**: More nuanced accountability (Tech Lead, Product Owner, etc.)
- **Need**: Better logic to determine accountability based on workflow context

#### 3. Consultation Patterns
- **Current**: Limited consultation detection
- **HTML Shows**: Rich consultation between personas (e.g., developers consult architects)
- **Need**: Analyze workflow steps more deeply for implicit consultations

#### 4. Phase Organization
- **Current**: Have phases but not all activities grouped correctly
- **HTML Shows**: Clear phase boundaries with multiple activities per phase

### Specific Examples from HTML vs My Extraction:

#### Feature Development (wf0):
**HTML Shows**:
- Developer: R for implement changes, commit code
- Tech Lead: A for most activities
- Code Reviewer: C for review activities
- Product Owner: C for requirements, I for progress

**My Extraction Shows**:
- Only accountable assignments (software-architect)
- Missing responsible assignments
- Limited consultation patterns

### Recommendations for Improvement:

1. **Add Default Responsible Personas for System Workflows**:
   - wf0-wf3: Developers (backend/frontend)
   - wf4-wf8: Configuration/Release Engineers
   - wf9-wf11: SRE/DevOps Engineers
   - wf12-wf17: Various based on context

2. **Enhance Accountability Logic**:
   - Feature work: Software Architect or Tech Lead
   - Bug fixes: Engineering Manager
   - Hotfixes: SRE Lead
   - Security: Security Architect

3. **Improve Consultation Detection**:
   - Code changes → Consult architects
   - Testing → Consult QA engineers
   - Deployment → Consult DevOps
   - UI changes → Consult UX designers

4. **Better Inform Patterns**:
   - Management informed of delays/blockers
   - Product owners informed of feature progress
   - Security team informed of vulnerabilities
